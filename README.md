# How-to-solve-constrained-optimisation-problems-in-MATLAB
This post explains how to set up a constrained optimisation problem using MATLAB. Weâ€™ll be working with three files: the main file (fmincon_main_file.m) and two function files defining the objective function and the constraint (mycost.m and myprod.m).
